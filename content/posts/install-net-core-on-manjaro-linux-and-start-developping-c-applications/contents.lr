##### Introduction
.NET is an open-source development framework platform available free to use and install on all popular operating systems such as Windows, GNU/Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is cross-platform, and a successor of the proprietary .NET Framework primarily developed by Microsoft employees under the .NET Foundation.
It is built on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps as mentioned in Microsoft Docs

If we talk about .NET Developers, then they are software developers who develop programs and technologies using the Microsoft Dot NET platform. Although .NET supports the C#, F#, and Visual Basic (VB.NET) programming languages, programmers prefer C# in most cases because it allows the  .NET specialists to develop different types of software: from the ordinary web and desktop applications to mobile applications and games.
##### Advantages of .NET
   -  Offers seamless horizontal scalability where you can easily find tools in the Microsoft Developer Network
   - Enables the development of a wide range of applications on various platforms
   - Offers flexible deployment and easy maintenance
   - Supports code sharing and code reusability 
   -  Provides efficient data access and an integrated programming environment
   - Includes automated memory management
Not to mention that .NET looks really wide and the future of .NET is very bright. it proved itself a modern, reliable, secure, powerful & versatile framework in the last 20 years suitable for all platforms & from small to enterprise level software. No doubt that .NET has been improving over the years and brings new features with the every new update.

##### Installation
If you want to develop applications, the best way is to use the Manjaro repositories and install the .NET Core SDK
Search for ```dotnet-sdk```
```bash
pacman -Ss dotnet-sdk ``` 
You can install this with Pacman:
```bash 
pacman -S dotnet-sdk```
if you want the ASP.Net Runtime also search for ```aspnet-runtime: 
```bash
pacman -Ss aspnet-runtime```
Then install by running : 
```bash 
pacman -S dotnet-sdk```

##### Create a new application
Letâ€™s create a new Blazor application to test the .NET SDK on our Manjaro machine. Type in the following:
```bash
dotnet new blazorserver -o BlazorTest --no-https
```
This will create a new Blazor application.
let's run it :
```bash
cd BlazorTest
dotnet watch
```
Using ```dotnet watch``` you can run your application and use hot reload. This way you can make changes in real time.
